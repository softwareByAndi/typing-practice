# math-practice
for those who want just 5 quick minutes of mental math to keep the mind sharp, this is a js script for practicing some random math equations in the terminal.

## interface looks like this

``` text

 Math Practice - round 3

 12 * 36 = 

```

## aliasing

I recommend adding an alias to your bashrc or zshrc to make it easier to run the script. 
``` bash
code ~/.bashrc
```

``` bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias math-practice="node ~/path/to/repository/math-practice/math_practice.js"
```

``` bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
